# Frankfurt Environment Dashboard (Work in Progress)

This is an ongoing data science project to build an environmental dashboard for Frankfurt am Main, Germany.  
It combines open satellite data (Sentinel-5P, MODIS, Sentinel-2) with ground-based air quality measurements (OpenAQ) to visualize:

- Air quality (NO₂ concentrations)
- Urban heat and surface temperature
- Vegetation and greenness patterns

---

The project is currently in early development and will be expanded step by step.
